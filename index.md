#### I am an Associate Professor of Instruction in the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department at the University of Iowa. I have a doctoral degree in industrial engineering from the University of Cincinnati, a Master of Science degree in industrial engineering from Bradley University, and a Bachelor of Engineering degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Madras, India. My research and teaching specializations are in human factors engineering and ergonomics. 

Here's **my most recent book** co-authored with Drs. K.S. Krishnamoorthi and V.R. Krishnamoorthi: [A First Course in Quality Engineering: Integrating Statistical and Management Methods of Quality](https://www.crcpress.com/A-First-Course-in-Quality-Engineering-Integrating-Statistical-and-Management/Krishnamoorthi-Krishnamoorthi-Pennathur/p/book/9781498764209) (K.S. Krishnamoorthi, V.R. Krishnamoorthi and A. Pennathur), 3rd Edition, CRC Press, New York, NY, **2018.**

Here are three other books I've helped edit:

[Resources Utilization and Productivity Enhancement Case Studies](http://www.momentumpress.net/books/resources-utilization-and-productivity-enhancement-case-studies) (Editors: A. Mital and A. Pennathur), Momentum Press, New Jersey: USA, 2015.

[Human Work Productivity: A Global Perspective](https://www.crcpress.com/Human-Work-Productivity-A-Global-Perspective/Kumar-Mital-Pennathur/p/book/9781439874141) (Editors: S. Kumar, A. Mital and A. Pennathur), CRC Press (Taylor & Francis), New York, NY, 2014. (*Outstanding Academic Title Award Winner from CRC Press*)

[Industrial Resource Utilization and Productivity: Understanding the Linkages](http://www.momentumpress.net/books/industrial-resource-utilization-and-productivity) (Editors: A. Mital and A. Pennathur), Momentum Press, New Jersey: USA, August 2010.

My recent papers are:

A. Pennathur, P. Pennathur and J. Tsou, **Integrating normative ethical theories for macro ethics in HF research**, *2020 IISE Annual Conference*, New Orleans, LA, Paper Accepted December 2019.

A. Pennathur, P. Pennathur and N. Bowman, **Minority engineering student success in predominantly white institutions: Sociotechnical analyses**, *2020 IISE Annual Conference*, New Orleans, LA, Paper Accepted December 2019. 



I am now an Honorary Editor-in-Chief in the International Journal of Industrial Engineering - Theory, Applications and Practice (IJIETAP) which I edited from 2000 to 2014. As the Editor-in-Chief for IJIETAP for 14 years, I grew the journal to attract a worldwide audience, and migrated the journal from a print to an online publication. I have also served on the editorial boards of many research journals, and have helped organize research conferences (you can find details in my research page).

I am a member of the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), the Institute for Industrial and Systems Engineers, and the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society. 

I am also a member of the leadership team and the webmaster for the [North Midwest Section of the ASEE](http://nms.asee.org)
